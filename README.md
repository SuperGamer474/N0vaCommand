# N0vaCommand ![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-yellow)

Terminal-based OS for Windows. Includes a package manager (ncpm), and heaps of built-in commands!

**Coming soon:** Scripting language (ncsl), and nano-style editor (nce)!

Lightweight. Modern. Powerful.

> # Warning
> This project is still in developement, and is not finished. It will probably have bugs, and none of the components are completely finished. Feel free to use N0vaCommand until I release the first version, although this may not be for quite a while. Thanks, SuperGamer474
